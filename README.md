# INTRODUCING FLUTTER AND GETTING STARTED
*In chapter one, I learned the foundational concepts of the Flutter framework. Flutter is an open-source SDK used for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop, allowing for fast, high-performance development. Its key benefits include cross-platform capabilities, fast development cycles, and beautiful, customizable UI components.also discovered that Flutter uses the Dart programming language, which is specifically designed to work efficiently with Flutter

The core of Flutter is built around widgets—the basic elements used to create the UI. Widgets can be stateless, meaning they don’t change once created or stateful, meaning they can update dynamically based on user interaction or other events. I learned about elements, which are the runtime representations of widgets and render objects, responsible for laying out and drawing the visual representation of widgets on the screen.

The chapter also introduced the lifecycle of stateful and stateless widgets and how Flutter’s widget tree and element tree work together. The widget tree defines the structure of the UI, while the element tree is the runtime manifestation of the widgets.

Additionally, I learned how to install the Flutter SDK, which is essential for creating Flutter applications, and how to install development tools like Xcode on macOS and Android Studio on macOS, Windows, and Linux. These tools help in building, debugging, and testing Flutter apps.
